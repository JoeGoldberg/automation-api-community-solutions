# Orchestrate AWS Predictive Maintenance Workflows with BMC Helix Control-M
The artifacts in this repo implement a Predictive Maintenance workflow with BMC Helix Control-M, a SaaS application and data pipeline workflow orchestration solution.

You can find the latest Control-M Automation API documentation, including a programming guide, on the [**project web page**](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/public/workloadautomation/Control-M+Automation+API+-+Getting+Started+Guide).

**NOTE**: In this implementation, emr-serverless is invoked on an ec2 instance and depends on the instance metadata for account information
